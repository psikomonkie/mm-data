overview:The Goliath is used as a general assault 'Mech and until recently was not usually seen in large numbers because of the bias against quad 'Mechs prior to the 3060s.

capabilities:The Goliath is armed with what would be considered a paltry armament for a 'Mech of its size.

deployment:The 3M is a 3047 upgrade of the Goliath that uses Star League technology. The 'Mech has had an Hermes 320 XL Engine installed to reduce the engine's weight by half. The 'Mech retains the LRM launchers and Machine Guns of the 1H model. The 'Mech replaces the PPC with a Zeus Slingshot Gauss Rifle which gives the Goliath devastating long-range firepower. The 'Mech still suffers from its close combat deficiencies but with its updated arsenal most 'Mechs are hard pressed to close to short range.

history:The Goliath is the second 'Mech built in 2652 by Brigadier Corporation. The Goliath is based on lessons that were learned from the Scorpion. The first and most important difference is that the Goliath weighs in at 80 tons allowing it to carry a much heavier weapons payload and armor at the cost of mobility. In the late 3060s the Goliath saw renewed production and renewed popularity and has since become a powerful and respected assault 'Mech. In 3143, The Corean Enterprises - MacAdams-Suharno plant on Stewart was captured by Clan Wolf, and it's GOL-6M variant production line converted to produce a Clan version of the 'Mech.
